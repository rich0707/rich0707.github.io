            <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>
                  My name is Joel Richardson. I had my 21<sup>st</sup> birthday this year. I am currently a student at Algonquin College in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program. I enjoy photo and video editing but have been curious about web development for some time. My current goal for this course is to create a <em>professional portfolio website</em> for the work I have done in the past as well as any projects I will create in the future.

                  Whenever I have free time, I like to play video games. Final Fantasy XIV is my main game right now. I play with my brother and a small group of friends. Another cool game I'm playing right now is Hades. I also have a 6 year old golden retriever named Dexter who I love very much.
